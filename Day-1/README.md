# Week-13 -- Day-1

## Webpack

Webpack seems to be the first concept that truly complicates front-end web-development. No more pure HTML, CSS JavasScript to create our web pages. Simply put, Webpack is simply a tool for bundling modules. I don't know about you but this doesn't make too much sense when you are first learning web-development. For now just remember that it's a tool for bundling modules. And I would like to add it's trying to transpile dynamic content to static content. But again this is not easy to understand when you are first starting out as a web developer.

Let's get to it.

### Getting Starting with Webpack

Before you can start working with webpack you need to make sure you have node and by extension npm installed. You can just run `npm --version` and `node --version` to see if you have them installed.

I will not copy and paste from the getting started page I shared above. I have gone through the tutorial with previous co-horts and most students have successfully been able to follow it. Make sure you can all the steps and you can load the final html in the dist folder without any errors in the browser's console.
